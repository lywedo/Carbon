## Step 1
### There are two buttons in the screen. The first is main entry, and it shows the intranet ip address of this device. the game can receive http message from other device in the same intranet, so it shows the ip to inform that. The second button is cache cleaning, cause the game will record the game progress locally, so you may find the farms built by previous rounds, so it offers the button to clean them.
